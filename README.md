# TeacherReportHelper
This is an app that will generate teacher reports based on average grades. The app also highlights pupils with negative behaviour points.

TRH is created with React.JS and material/ui. This is still a work in progress and will continue to be updated over the next few months. Currenly pupil data is parsed from a JSON file. I intend to have data pulled from Google Sheets api
